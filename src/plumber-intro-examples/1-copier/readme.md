# Basic Dataflow Construction

This is a example for the basic dataflow construction and execution in Plumber.

The example will read the standard input and copy the read result to the standard output.
`copier.pss` is the dataflow graph definition in the PScript configuration language.

Use `pscript copier.pss` to run the example.
