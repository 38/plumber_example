		<h1>Static File Server Example (fileserver.pss)</h1>
		<ul id="toc">
		</ul>
		<h2 class="section">What is it?</h2>
		<p>
			This file is the entry point of the static file server, you can start the server by running this script.
			The server is written in the Plumber Service Script (PSS), the script language used by the Plumber Framework. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">How does it work?</h2>
		<p>
			The Plumber Service Script uses the PSS interpreter called pscript. When you start the server, you are actually
			running the pscript interpreter. The interesting part of the script is, the script only initialize the server 
			which handling the HTTP requests, but itself doesn't handling any request.
		</p>
		<p>
			A service is defined by the service graph literal in the PSS language, and once you run the <em>start</em> statement
			in the PSS, the service described by the service graph will start serving traffic. Let's look at the service graph 
			we are current using. (Please note in this graph we ignored all the error handling pipes)
		</p>
		<center><img src="/service_graph.png" style="width:300px"/></center>
		<p>
			The request comes from the input, which can be either port 8080 for HTTP and port 4343 for HTTPS. When the request
			comes from the network, it will be handled by the node called "parsereq". And the content of the request will be 
			sent to the pipe endpoint called "request". The servlet produces three output: 
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>path</strong> The path the client is requesting </li>
				<li> <strong>host</strong> The host name, which will be used when we enable the virtual hosting </li>
				<li> <strong>error</strong> Indicates the servlet just got a invalid request</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			After we parsed the request, the path the client is requesting will be sent to the path parser and the path parser will
			produce the relative path and the extension name. The extension name will be sent to the servlet "guessmime", it will 
			guess the file type based on the extension name. 
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, the relative path will be sent to the readfile servlet, it will read the file from the disk and sends
			the result to the response render.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, the response render will take the file content and mime type information and render a HTTP response and write
			to the network.
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">How is the graph Created?</h2>
		<p>
			As we previously said, it's created by the service graph literal in the Plumber Service Script language. The service literal
			is a simple domain specific language used to connect different servlet into a service graph. It is wrapped with a pair of curly
			braces, for example:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>	service_graph = { 
		/* Your service definition comes here */ 
	}</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			The service definition has two parts, the node definition and the graph definition. The nodes definition defines what servlet do
			we have in the service graph. It looks like
			<p>
				<code>	dup_your_input := "dataflow/dup 3";</code>
			</p>
			This will create a node which reads from the input pipe and produces 3 copy of the input.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once we have all the servlet node we need in the graph, we will be able to connect them and make a real graph. The basic syntax
			to connect two endpoints are quite straight forward. It looks like:
			<p>
				<code>	upstream_node "output" -&gt; "input" downstream_node;
	() -&gt; "input" input_node;
	output_node "output" -&gt; ();</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			To make life easier, the PSS provides some syntactical sugar to reduce the code you need to write. First, you can chaining the
			pipe definition. For example
			<p>
				<code>	nodeA "output" -&gt; "input" nodeB "output" -&gt; "input" nodeC;</code>
			</p>
			means 
			<p>
				<code>	nodeA "output" -&gt; "input" nodeB;
	nodeB "output" -&gt; "input" nodeC; </code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Second, we are able to simplify the code if we are talking about the same servlet, for example
			<p>
				<code>	nodeA {
		"output1" -&gt; "input" nodeB;
		"output2" -&gt; "input" nodeC;
	}</code>
			</p>
			means
			<p>
				<code>	nodeA "output1" -&gt; "input" nodeB;
	nodeA "output2" -&gt; "input" nodeC;</code>
			</p>
			In fact we can do it for either input pipe or output pipes or both, for example:
			<p>
				<code>	nodeA {
		"output1" -&gt; "input1";
		"output2" -&gt; "input2";
	} nodeB;</code>
			</p>
			means
			<p>
				<code>	nodeA "output1" -&gt; "input1" nodeB;
	nodeA "output2" -&gt; "input2" nodeB;</code>
			</p>
		</p>

		<h2 class="section">Graph in Real World</h2>
		Now let's look at the service graph for the static file server. Let's translate the graph shown above to serivce literal
		<p>
			<code>	file_server = {
		// Definition of the nodes we need to use
		parsereq   := "parsereq";
		parsepath  := "filesystem/parsepath --ext-name";
		readfile   := "filesystem/readfile ./environment/server_files";
		guessmime  := "filesystem/mime ./environment/mime.types";
		genres     := "genres";

		// Definition of the interconnections
		() -&gt; "request" parsereq "path" -&gt; "origin" parsepath {
				"relative" -&gt; "path" readfile "result" -&gt; "file";
				"extname" -&gt; "extname" guessmime "mimetype" -&gt; "mime";
		} genres "output" -&gt; ();
	}</code>
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">Adding error handling to the service</h2>
		<p>	
			Here's one more question remaining, what if the server is error. Actually, the 404 error is handled by read file. However
			what if the server gets an invalid request, or a request trying accessing system file, or even the servlet failed to complete. 
			In this case, we need error handling.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to handle the servlet failure, the Plumber framework provides a mechanism called signal pipe. The framework will automatically
			define a pipe called "__error__" for every servlet, and it will be empty if the servlet runs sucessfully. However, it will be written
			by the framework whenever the servlet returns an error code. So handling the servlet failure is quite simple in this way. 
			<p>
				<code>	error := "dataflow/firstnonempty 4";
	{
		parsereq  "__error__" -&gt; "in0";
		parsepath "__error__" -&gt; "in1";
		readfile  "__error__" -&gt; "in2";
		guessmime "__error__" -&gt; "in3";
	} error "out" -&gt; "500" genres; </code>
			</p>
			<p>
				You may ask what if the "error" node or "genres" node failed to run? The answer is, consider a normal HTTP server, if there's some
				failure with code that produces HTTP response, there's no way for client to see the 500 error. The situation in here is similar,
				If node "error" or "genres" is encountering an error, client won't get any response.
			</p>
			<p>
			Similarly, the node "parsepath" won't let any dangerous path to pass through, for example "../../../password.txt". In this case, we need
			to use another type of signal pipe, "__null__". This is the signal pipe that will be activated when there's no other pipe has been touched
			by the servlet. In our example, when the "parsepath" node reject to serve the request, "__null__" pipe will be activated. In this case,
			we should return a forbiden response.
			<p>
				<code>	parsepath "__null__" -&gt; "403" genres;</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			Finally, let's think about what if the server gets a malformed HTTP request from network. In this case, the "error" pipe of "parsereq" will
			have some output, and we should let the response render know about this and produce a bad request response.
			<p>
				<code>	parseres "error" -&gt; "400" genres;</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">How does our server listening to the outside</h2>
		<p>
			Now we have a service graph serves the static content and handling the errors. But here's one more thing, how the service listening to the outside.
			The Plumber framework uses an unified pipelining interface, and below the interface, the Inter-Task Communication Modules are used to perform the
			actual IO operation. As you can imagine, the TCP protocol is wrapped by the ITC module called TCP Pipe. And the TCP module is responsible for listening
			to the outside of the world. 
			<p>
				<code>	insmod "tcp_pipe 8080";</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			The code above will initialize a TCP module which listening to the 8080 port. Once there's an HTTP request, the TCP module will bubble a event and
			activate the service that is running. Of couses, you are able to initialize multiple TCP modules on different ports at the same time, 
			so that we can make our service listing to multiple ports at the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are able to initialize a TLS module over a TCP module to enable the HTTPS support.
			<p>
				<code>	insmod "tcp_pipe --slave 4343";
	insmod "tls_pipe cert=cert.pem key=key.pem pipe.tcp.port_4343";</code>
			</p>
