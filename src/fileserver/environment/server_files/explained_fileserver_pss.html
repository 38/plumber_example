		<h1>Static File Server Example (<a href="fileserver.pss.txt">fileserver.pss</a>)</h1>
		<ul id="toc">
		</ul>
		<h2 class="section">What is it?</h2>
		<p>
			This file is the entry point of the static file server, you can start the server by running this script.
			The server is written in the Plumber Service Script (PSS), the script language used by the Plumber Framework. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">How does it work?</h2>
		<p>
			The Plumber Service Script uses a script interpreter called pscript. When you start the server, you are actually
			running a script in pscript interpreter. The intersting part of the language is, although Plumber framework is desgined
			for high performance applications, the script language itself doesn't have any performance optimization.
			Instead of serving traffic from the network, the script code is responsible build the service you need and launch it. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In Plumber framework, services are built up with basic build blocks called servlets (Note please distinguish with Java
			Servlet). Each servlet is a tiny piece of program with one or more input ports and output ports. When a servlet is
			activated, it reads the input ports and writes the output ports. Plumber framework provides servlets a runtime environment
			that connects the ports with pipes in a desired way. An application is built up by connecting those servlets into a
			graph.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Plumber framework provides a visualization of the service we have made. In the graph, each servlet is represtented by 
			a node. There's three rows in the servlet node.
			<center><img src="servlet_repr.png" style="width:300px"/></center>
			<ul>
				<li>First row is the list of input ports</li>
				<li>The second row has two signal pipe "N" and "E", which we will discuss later, and the name of the servlet</li>
				<li>The last line is the list of output port</li>
			</ul>
			Let's look at the service graph that is currently serving traffic.
		</p>
		<center><img src="service_graph.png" style="width:400px"/></center>
		<p>
			The request comes from the input, which can be either port 8080 for HTTP and port 4343 for HTTPS. When the request
			comes from network, it will be handled by the request parser. And the content of the request will be 
			sent to the pipe port called "request". The servlet produces three output: 
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>path</strong> The path the client is requesting </li>
				<li> <strong>host</strong> (Not in use) The host name, which will be used when we enable the virtual hosting </li>
				<li> <strong>error</strong> (Not in use) Indicates the servlet just got a invalid request</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			After the request parser parsed the request, the path the client is requesting will be sent to the path parser. The path 
			parser will simplify the path and extract the extension name from the original path.
		</p>
		<p>
			The extension name extracted by the path parser will be sent to the MIME guesser to determine which MIME type we should use
			in the response.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, the relative path will be sent to the file reader, and the reader reads the file from the disk and sends
			the read result to the response generator.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, the response generator takes the file content and type information and produce a HTTP response to the client. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">How is the graph created?</h2>
		<p>
			A service is defined by the service graph literal in the PSS language, and once you run the <em>start</em> statement
			in the PSS, the service described by the service graph will start serving traffic. 		
		</p>
		<p>
			As we previously said, it's created by the service graph literal in the Plumber Service Script language. The service literal
			is a simple domain specific language used to connect different servlet into a service graph. It is wrapped with a pair of curly
			braces, for example:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code class="pss">service_graph = { 
	// Your service definition comes here
}</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			The service definition has two parts, the node definition and the graph definition. The nodes definition defines what servlet do
			we have in the service graph. It looks like
			<p>
				<code class="pss">dup_your_input := "dataflow/dup 3";</code>
			</p>
			This will create a node which reads from the input pipe and produces 3 copy of the input.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once we have all the servlet node we need in the graph, we will be able to connect them and make a real graph. The basic syntax
			to connect two endpoints are quite straight forward. It looks like:
			<p>
				<code class="pss">upstream_node "output" -&gt; "input" downstream_node;
() -&gt; "input" input_node;
output_node "output" -&gt; ();</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			To make life easier, the PSS provides some syntactical sugar to reduce the code you need to write. First, you can chaining the
			pipe definition. For example
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA "output" -&gt; "input" nodeB "output" -&gt; "input" nodeC;</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			means 
			</p>
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA "output" -&gt; "input" nodeB;
nodeB "output" -&gt; "input" nodeC; </code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Second, we are able to simplify the code if we are talking about the same servlet, for example
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA {
	"output1" -&gt; "input" nodeB;
	"output2" -&gt; "input" nodeC;
}</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			means
			</p>
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA "output1" -&gt; "input" nodeB;
nodeA "output2" -&gt; "input" nodeC;</code>
			In fact we can do it for either input pipe or output pipes or both, for example:
			</p>
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA {
	"output1" -&gt; "input1";
	"output2" -&gt; "input2";
} nodeB;</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			means
			</p>
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA "output1" -&gt; "input1" nodeB;
nodeA "output2" -&gt; "input2" nodeB;</code>
			</p>
		</p>

		<h2 class="section">Graph in Real World</h2>
		Now let's look at the service graph for the static file server. Let's translate the graph shown above to serivce literal
		<p>
			<code class="pss">file_server = {
	// Definition of the nodes we need to use
	RequestParser     := "parsereq";
	PathParser        := "filesystem/parsepath --ext-name";
	FileReader        := "filesystem/readfile ./environment/server_files";
	MIMEGuesser       := "filesystem/mime ./environment/mime.types";
	ResponseGenerator := "genres";

	// Definition of the interconnections
	() -&gt; "request" RequestParser "path" -&gt; "origin" PathParser {
			"relative" -&gt; "path" FileReader "result" -&gt; "file";
			"extname" -&gt; "extname" MIMEGuesser "mimetype" -&gt; "mime";
	} ResponseGenerator "output" -&gt; ();
}</code>
		</p>
		<center><img src="service_graph.png" style="width:400px"/></center>
		<h2 class="section">Adding error handling to the service</h2>
		<p>	
			Here's one more question remaining, what if the server is error. Actually, the 404 error is handled by read file. However
			what if the server gets an invalid request, or a request trying accessing system file, or even the servlet failed to complete. 
			In this case, we need error handling.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to handle the servlet failure, the Plumber framework provides a mechanism called signal pipe. The framework will automatically
			define a pipe called "__error__" for every servlet, and it will be empty if the servlet runs sucessfully. However, it will be written
			by the framework whenever the servlet returns an error code. So handling the servlet failure is quite simple in this way. 
			<p>
				<code class="pss">ErrorCombiner := "dataflow/firstnonempty 4";
{
	RequestParser  "__error__" -&gt; "in0";
	PathParser     "__error__" -&gt; "in1";
	FileReader     "__error__" -&gt; "in2";
	MIMEGuesser    "__error__" -&gt; "in3";
} ErrorCombiner "out" -&gt; "500" ResponseGenerator; </code>
			</p>
			<p>
				You may ask what if the "error" node or "genres" node failed to run? The answer is, consider a normal HTTP server, if there's some
				failure with code that produces HTTP response, there's no way for client to see the 500 error. The situation in here is similar,
				If node "error" or "genres" is encountering an error, client won't get any response.
			</p>
			<p>
			Similarly, the node "parsepath" won't let any dangerous path to pass through, for example "../../../password.txt". In this case, we need
			to use another type of signal pipe, "__null__". This is the signal pipe that will be activated when there's no other pipe has been touched
			by the servlet. In our example, when the "parsepath" node reject to serve the request, "__null__" pipe will be activated. In this case,
			we should return a forbiden response.
			<p>
				<code class="pss">PathParser "__null__" -&gt; "403" ResponseGenerator;</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			Finally, let's think about what if the server gets a malformed HTTP request from network. In this case, the "error" pipe of "parsereq" will
			have some output, and we should let the response render know about this and produce a bad request response.
			<p>
				<code class="pss">RequestParser "error" -&gt; "400" ResponseGenerator;</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">How does our server listening to the outside</h2>
		<p>
			Now we have a service graph serves the static content and handling the errors. But here's one more thing, how the service listening to the outside.
			The Plumber framework uses an unified pipelining interface, and below the interface, the Inter-Task Communication Modules are used to perform the
			actual IO operation. As you can imagine, the TCP protocol is wrapped by the ITC module called TCP Pipe. And the TCP module is responsible for listening
			to the outside of the world. 
			<p>
				<code class="pss">insmod "tcp_pipe 8080";</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			The code above will initialize a TCP module which listening to the 8080 port. Once there's an HTTP request, the TCP module will bubble a event and
			activate the service that is running. Of couses, you are able to initialize multiple TCP modules on different ports at the same time, 
			so that we can make our service listing to multiple ports at the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are able to initialize a TLS module over a TCP module to enable the HTTPS support.
			<p>
				<code class="pss">insmod "tcp_pipe --slave 4343";
insmod "tls_pipe cert=cert.pem key=key.pem pipe.tcp.port_4343";</code>
			</p>
