		<h1>Static File Server Example (<a href="fileserver.pss.txt">fileserver.pss</a>)</h1>
		<ul id="toc">
		</ul>
		<h2 class="section">What is it?</h2>
		<p>
			This file is the entry point of the static file server, you can start the server by running this script.
			The server is written in the Plumber Service Script (PSS), the script language used by the Plumber Framework. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">How does it work?</h2>
		<p>
			The Plumber Service Script uses a script interpreter called pscript. When you start the server, you are actually
			running a script in pscript interpreter. The intersting part of the language is, although Plumber framework is desgined
			for high performance applications, the script language itself doesn't have any performance optimization.
			Instead of serving traffic from the network, the script code is responsible build the service you need and launch it. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In Plumber framework, services are built up with basic build blocks called servlets (Note please distinguish with Java
			Servlet). Each servlet is a tiny piece of program with one or more input ports and output ports. When a servlet is
			activated, it reads the input ports and writes the output ports. Plumber framework provides servlets a runtime environment
			that connects the ports with pipes in a desired way. An application is built up by connecting those servlets into a
			graph.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Plumber framework provides a visualization of the service we have made. In the graph, each servlet is represtented by 
			a node.
		</p>
		<p>
			<code class="pss">visualize service &gt;&gt;&gt; "path-to-the-output"</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			The following picture is a sample of visualization of a servlet node. There are three rows in the servlet node visualization.
			<center><img src="servlet_repr.png" style="width:300px"/></center>
			<ul>
				<li>First row is the list of input ports</li>
				<li>The second row has two signal pipe "N" and "E", which we will discuss later, and the name of the servlet</li>
				<li>The last row is the list of output port</li>
			</ul>
			Let's look at the service graph that is currently serving traffic. (Note this time we have ignored all the error handling pipes)
		</p>
		<center><img src="service_graph.png" style="width:400px"/></center>
		<p>
			There are 5 servlet nodes in our server, RequestParser, PathParser, FileReader, MIMEGuesser and ResponseGenerator. Each servlet 
			node is a program reads inputs and writes output.
			<ul>
				<li> <p>
					<strong>RequestParser: </strong> 
					Reads HTTP request from the request port and produces the path and the host name client requesting.
					When the parser gets a malformed HTTP request, "error" port will be touched, but other outputs will remains empty.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p>
					<strong>PathParser: </strong>
					Reads the original path from the port "origin" and extract simplified path and extension name. For example, if the 
					original path is "/path/to/file/../file.txt", it will produce "/path/to/file.txt" in the "relative" port and 
					"txt" in the "extname" port. (Note: this time let's ignore the "prefix" port) </p>
				</li>
				<li><p>
					<strong>FileReader: </strong>
					Reads a relative path from the "path" port and produces the file content to the "result" port. </p>
				</li>
				<li><p>
					<strong>MIMEGuesser: </strong>
					Reads a extension name from the "extname" port and try to guess what MIME type the extension name stands for.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p>
					<strong>ResponseGenerator: </strong>
					Reads the file content from "file" port and MIME type information from the "mime" port and produces the HTTP response
					to the "output" port. It also accept some signals (400, 403, 500) to produces error responses.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The external request comes from the input node. Once a request have been received, it will be handled by the request parser. 
			And the content of the request will be sent to the "request" port of RequestParser.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the request parser parsed the request, the path the client requesting will be sent to the path parser. And the PathParser
			is responsible to simplify the path and extract the extension name of the requested file.
		</p>
		<p>
			After that the MIME guesser will take the extension name extracted by the PathParser, and determine which MIME type we should use
			in the response.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the same time, the relative path will be sent to the file reader. It will read the file from the disk and sends
			the content of the file to the response generator.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, the response generator takes the file content and MIME type information to produce a HTTP response for the client.
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">How is the service graph created?</h2>
		<p>
			A service is defined by the service graph literal in the PSS language, and once you run the <em>start</em> statement
			in the PSS, the service described by the service graph will start serving traffic. 		
		</p>
		<p>
			As we previously said, it's created by the service graph literal in the Plumber Service Script language. The service literal
			is a simple domain specific language used to connect different servlet node into a service graph. It should be wrapped with a 
			pair of curly braces, for example:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code class="pss">service_graph = { 
	// Your service definition comes here
}</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			The service definition has two parts, the node definition and the graph definition. The nodes definition defines what servlet do
			we have in the service graph. It looks like
			<p>
				<code class="pss">dup_your_input := "dataflow/dup 3";</code>
			</p>
			This will create a node which reads from the input pipe and produces 3 copies of the input.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once we have all the servlet nodes we need in the graph, we will be able to connect them and build the service we want. The basic syntax
			to connect two endpoints are quite straight forward. It looks like:
			<p>
				<code class="pss">upstream_node "output" -&gt; "input" downstream_node;
() -&gt; "input" input_node;
output_node "output" -&gt; ();</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			To make life easier, the PSS provides syntactical sugar to reduce the code that is needed. First, we can chaining the
			pipe definition. For example
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA "output" -&gt; "input" nodeB "output" -&gt; "input" nodeC;</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			means 
			</p>
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA "output" -&gt; "input" nodeB;
nodeB "output" -&gt; "input" nodeC; </code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Second, we can simplify the code when we are talking about the different port of the same servlet, for example
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA {
	"output1" -&gt; "input" nodeB;
	"output2" -&gt; "input" nodeC;
}</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			means
			</p>
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA "output1" -&gt; "input" nodeB;
nodeA "output2" -&gt; "input" nodeC;</code>
			We can use this syntax for either inputs or outputs, or even both, for example:
			</p>
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA {
	"output1" -&gt; "input1";
	"output2" -&gt; "input2";
} nodeB;</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			means
			</p>
			<p>
				<code class="pss">nodeA "output1" -&gt; "input1" nodeB;
nodeA "output2" -&gt; "input2" nodeB;</code>
			</p>
		</p>

		<h2 class="section">Graph in Real World</h2>
		<p>
			Now let's look at our static file server again and translate the graph shown above to serivce literal
		</p>
		<center><img src="service_graph.png" style="width:400px"/></center>
		<p>
			<code class="pss">file_server = {
	// Definition of the nodes we need to use
	RequestParser     := "parsereq";
	PathParser        := "filesystem/parsepath --ext-name";
	FileReader        := "filesystem/readfile ./environment/server_files";
	MIMEGuesser       := "filesystem/mime ./environment/mime.types";
	ResponseGenerator := "genres";

	// Definition of the interconnections
	() -&gt; "request" RequestParser "path" -&gt; "origin" PathParser {
		"relative" -&gt; "path" FileReader "result" -&gt; "file";
		"extname" -&gt; "extname" MIMEGuesser "mimetype" -&gt; "mime";
	} ResponseGenerator "output" -&gt; ();
}</code>
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">Adding error handling to the service</h2>
		<p>	
			Here's one more question remaining, what if someting is wrong with our server. For the 404 error is handled by the file reader. 
			However what if the server gets an invalid request, or a request trying accessing system file? What can we do when a servlet fails.
			In this case, we need error handling.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to handle the servlet failure, the Plumber framework provides a mechanism called signal pipes. The framework will automatically
			define a pipe called "__error__" for every servlet (which is perviously visualized as port "E"), and it will be empty if the servlet 
			runs sucessfully. However, it will be written by the framework whenever the servlet returns an error code. So handling the servlet 
			failure is quite simple in this way. 
			<p>
				<code class="pss">ErrorCombiner := "dataflow/firstnonempty 4";
{
	RequestParser  "__error__" -&gt; "in0";
	PathParser     "__error__" -&gt; "in1";
	FileReader     "__error__" -&gt; "in2";
	MIMEGuesser    "__error__" -&gt; "in3";
} ErrorCombiner "out" -&gt; "500" ResponseGenerator; </code>
			</p>
			<p>
				You may ask what if the ErrorCombiner or ResponseGenerator fails? Well, consider other HTTP server, if there's some
				failure with code that produces HTTP response, there's no way for client to see even a 500 response. 
				The situation in here is similar, if those nodes fails, it's quite normal for the client to get an empty result.
			</p>
			<p>
			Similarly, the node PathParser won't let any dangerous path to pass through, for example "../../../password.txt". In this case, we need
			another type of signal pipe, "__null__". This is the signal pipe that will be activated when there's no other pipes havev been touched. 
			In our example, when the PathParser rejects the input path, there will be no output in normal port, but "__null__" pipe will be activated. 
			In this case, we should return a forbiden response.
			<p>
				<code class="pss">PathParser "__null__" -&gt; "403" ResponseGenerator;</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			Finally, let's think about what if the server gets a malformed HTTP request from network. In this case, the "error" pipe of RequestParser will
			have some output, and we should let the response render know about this and produce a bad request response.
			<p>
				<code class="pss">RequestParser "error" -&gt; "400" ResponseGenerator;</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2 class="section">How is our server listening</h2>
		<p>
			Now we have a service graph serves the static content and handling the errors. But, how the service listening to the outside and serve traffic ?
			The Plumber framework uses an unified pipelining interface, and below the interface, the IO Modules are used to perform the actual IO operation. 
			The TCP protocol is wrapped by an IO module called TCP Pipe Module. And the module is responsible for listening to the outside of the world. 
			<p>
				<code class="pss">insmod "tcp_pipe 8080";</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			The code above will initialize a TCP module which listening to the 8080 port. Once there's an HTTP request, the TCP module will bubble a event and
			the event will activate the service graph. Of couses, you are able to initialize multiple TCP modules on different TCP ports at the same time, 
			so that our server will be able to serve on different ports at the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also we have a module called TLS module which implements TLS over other IO module. You are able to initialize a TLS module over a TCP module to 
			enable the HTTPS support.
			<p>
				<code class="pss">insmod "tcp_pipe --slave 4343";
insmod "tls_pipe cert=cert.pem key=key.pem pipe.tcp.port_4343";</code>
			</p>
