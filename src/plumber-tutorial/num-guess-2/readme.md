# Number Guessing Game - 2

This is our second Number Guessing Game. The code is almost the same as the previous one, but made the change so that the framework 
will hold the TCP connection until the client hungs up.

## How to Compile

Similarly, make sure you are under the sandbox environment and run

```bash
make
```

## How to run

To start the Telnet server, please run

```bash
pscript telnet-guess.pss
```

To connect to the Telnet server, please run

```bash
telnet localhost 54321
```
